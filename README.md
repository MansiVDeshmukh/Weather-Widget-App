#Weather-Widget-App
Developed a responsive weather widget using React and Material-UI components, allowing users to search for any city and
view real-time weather updates. The widget displays key information including temperature, humidity, min/max temperature,
and “feels like” data. Integrated a public Weather API to fetch accurate, live weather information in a user-friendly card layout.
